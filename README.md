# U-Space-Services-dataset
This repertory contains a data set from the journal paper **Demonstrating Collaborative Advanced Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management Services in a Co-Simulation Environment** being a joint effort with PhD students of the ATM&amp;UTM laboratory at Cranfield University.

The Advanced Services, proposed here, envision U-Spaces levels 2 with high automation, 3, and 4 accordingly to the [U-Space Blueprint](https://www.sesarju.eu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/U-space%20Blueprint%20brochure%20final.PDF) and may correspond to how the UAS Traffic Management services may look like in the 2030s' and further.

The digitalisation of the services aims to address challenges toward a sustainable aviation ecosystem.

## Dataset for UAS Traffic Management

This repertory proposes simulation dataset considering more than 1,600 hours of operations into a airspace of 115NMÂ². We consider three different traffic densities : a low, moderate, and high densities for respectively 50, 100, and 150 operations.

## Pre-flight Services
The pre-flight services relaborate a flight plan from the operation request.

## In-flight Services
The in-flight services monitor the operation once activated.
