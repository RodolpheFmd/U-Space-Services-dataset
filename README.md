# U-Space-Services-dataset
This repertory contains a data set from the journal paper **Demonstrating Collaborative Advanced Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management Services in a Co-Simulation Environment** being a joint effort with PhD students of the ATM&amp;UTM laboratory at Cranfield University.

The Advanced Services, proposed here, envision U-Spaces levels 2 with high automation, 3, and 4 accordingly to the [U-Space Blueprint](https://www.sesarju.eu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/U-space%20Blueprint%20brochure%20final.PDF) and may correspond to how the UAS Traffic Management services may look like in the 2030s' and further.
