# Demonstrating Collaborative Advanced UTM Services in a Co-Simulation Environment - Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains data related to the journal paper titled "Demonstrating Collaborative Advanced UTM Services in a Co-Simulation Environment". The dataset aims to support research and development in Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) by providing comprehensive records of various experimental scenarios. These scenarios demonstrate advanced UTM services within a co-simulation environment, focusing on pre-flight and in-flight phases to ensure safe and efficient operations.

The co-simulation environment integrates multiple advanced U-space services, including Operation Plan Preparation, Risk Analysis and Assistance, Dynamic Capacity Management, and Strategic Conflict Resolution during the pre-flight phase. In-flight services include Conformance Monitoring, Contingency Management, and Tactical Conflict Resolution.

The Advanced Services, proposed here, envision U-Spaces levels 2 with high automation, 3, and 4 accordingly to the [U-Space Blueprint](https://www.sesarju.eu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/U-space%20Blueprint%20brochure%20final.PDF) and may correspond to how the UAS Traffic Management services may look like in the 2030s' and further.

The digitalisation of the services aims to address challenges towards a sustainable aviation ecosystem.

## Dataset for UAS Traffic Management

### Dataset structure

The baseline experiments do not involve any service and serve as comparison.
Each experiment contains at least this information:
- Operations: lists all the operations; their models, take-off and landing time.
- Settings: gives the settings related to the operational environment.
- Demo_records or tracking_info: logs the entire experiment.
- Further data can be provided depending on the folder.

Services are assessed in "Collaborative services" folder: 
- Individually in "Pre-flight services"
- Individually in "In-flight services"
- Collaboratively in "Unified services"
- With some combination in "Sensitivity analysis"
